# 🙋⚡️ Intellecture

Engage classrooms effectively, synchronously, and at scale.

## What is Intellecture?

Intellecture is an online tool to engage classrooms of any size. Traditionally, multiple choice questions (a.k.a. clicker questions) have been the only way for educators to synchronously evaluate student understanding during a live lecture. Intellecture aims to change this. With our tool, educators can write short to long-response discussion questions for a class. Then, Intellecture uses AI to identify common trends, themes, and topics in responses allowing educators to immediately evaluate student understanding and start discussions based on the response trends.

Intellecture is a pedagogy-agnostic tool. From making discussion-based flipped classrooms possible at the scale of hundreds to a simple check-in question with a class of twenty, teach the same way. **Teach your way.**

## The problem

> "Furthermore, not attendance itself but rather in-class engagement is responsible for students’ success. Consequently, the question that arises is how engagement, particularly in large classes with hundreds of students, can be enhanced."<sup>1<sup/>

> "The empirical results show that the digital lectures had a significantly higher attendance rate compared with the traditional campus-based lectures. There is also an indication of a steeper decline in the attendance rate over the term in the on-campus case compared with the lectures offered fully online"<sup>2<sup/>
